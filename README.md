# Retail Data Warehouse

This project builds a mini data warehouse for a fictional retail company to analyze sales performance by product, store, and time.

## Contents

- `schema.sql`: Table creation scripts
- `queries.sql`: Sample analytical queries
- `*.csv`: Dimension and fact data

## loading the data
- We used MySQL workbench hence it was easier to load the data into the various tables using the     - Table Data import wizard functionality by right clicking on the table, select table data import 
   wizard option, browse the csv file location and loaded it.
- This process was repeated for all 4 csv files

# Part 5: Reflection & Discussion
Discussion Questions:
# Q1 Why use a star schema instead of a normalized schema?

 
# Q2. What are the benefits of separating facts from dimensions?


# Q3. What types of business decisions could this warehouse support?
